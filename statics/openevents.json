If you would like to coach, please email us at team.london@opentechschool.org (that's so we can make sure we have enough coaches for people who are learning). </p> <p>You will need to bring a laptop, to work on the exercises, we will help you get set up with everything else on the day.</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing everybody then! </p> <p>Danielle, Gen + Vikki</p> <p>team.london@opentechschool.org</p>",

We're back at Electron Workshop for a rerun of the popular "Social Coding with Git"</p> <p><br/> </p> <p><b>About the workshop</b></p> <p>Enter the world of social coding with Git and GitHub! In this course we'll introduce you to Git, a popular tool for storing and sharing the source code to your programs (or even other files.) It’s a tool that keeps a copy of your files, but not just one copy. It keeps track of every version of every file in a repository.</p> <p>We'll also introduce GitHub, a free online service where over 2 million developers from around the world share their code. We'll show you how to share your code, meet like-minded programmers, and participate in other projects. You can even host simple websites using GitHub.</p> <p>Whether you just want to share a little script, connect with fellow programmers or contribute to some of the largest and most dynamic software projects in the world, we'll show you how to get started!</p> <p><b>This course requires no previous knowledge of Git and is suitable for</b> <b>beginners of any programming language</b>. <b>No programming will be required</b> <b>during the course</b>, but feel free to bring along your code for sharing on GitHub. You will need to bring your own laptop.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>About Our Workshops</b></p> <p>OpenTechSchool workshops are at-your-own-pace, with lots of coaches who are professional programmers themselves to give encouragement and guide you over the common pitfalls that many face when just starting out.</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/1/3/4/event_238936692.jpeg" /></p> <p>All you need to bring is a laptop and some enthusiasm! OpenTechSchool workshops are all with open-source, free software running on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. All course material is free and hosted online.</p> <p>Because the number of seats is limited, it is important that you only sign up if you definitely plan on coming (and do so, too!). If you can't make it for any reason, please cancel your attendance on Meetup right away so your someone on the waiting list can take your place. Thanks!</p> <p><b>About OpenTechSchool</b></p> <p>OpenTechSchool is a movement aiming to offer free tech education. Our events are open to technology enthusiasts of all genders, backgrounds, and experience levels, willing to coach or learn in a friendly environment. Our learning material is shared and collectively improved by the online community and anyone is welcome to use it to organize new OTS chapters anywhere in the world.</p>",

            "description": "<p>It's never been easier to make video games, thanks to the multitude of resources available and a growing worldwide community willing to help beginners. As a result, new games are being released every day, exploring different directions and tackling novel themes: playing is more stimulating and inclusive than ever.</p> <p>Talk &amp; Play is a bi-monthly meetup whose goal is to give a better idea of what it's like to create and play games today, providing the opportunity to local independent game makers to showcase their work in a friendly and relaxed environment. Everybody's welcome, whatever their background and knowledge level. If you like video games, we'll make sure you have a good time!</p> <p>The event is split into two parts:</p> <p>1. TALK: 2/3 short game-related talks (5 to 15 minutes), followed by a Q&amp;A session – it's all about sharing knowledge.</p> <p>2. PLAY: games made or chosen by the speakers will be shown; in addition, all participants are welcome to bring games they've made or are still working on – a perfect opportunity to discover and play new games, collect feedback and maybe find collaborators.</p> <p>To give you a better idea of what you're going to find, check out the summaries of the previous Talk &amp; Play: <a href="http://bit.ly/talkandplay1">#1</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/talkandplay2">#2</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/talkandplay3">#3</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/talkandplay4">#4</a> </p> <p>The Talk &amp; Play #5 speakers will be:</p> <p>—<b> <a href="http://plopesresearch.net">Pedro Lopes</a></b>, a PhD student of Prof. Patrick Baudisch's Human Computer Interaction lab in Hasso Plattner Institut, Berlin. Pedro investigates the future of interfaces, such as muscle-interfaces. A believer on the unification of art and research, often gives talks about it [BodyControlled, Campus Party 2013]. Makes and writes music using turntables [in eitr] and writes about music too [in <a href="http://jazz.pt/">jazz.pt</a> magazine]. </p> <p><br/>Talk Abstract: <b>Muscle-Propelled Games: playing games through our bodies</b></p> <p><i>Our research points out that "feeling forces" is the next step for increased realism in human computer interfaces, and a way of creating very small mobile devices. For a long time, the key to immersion in interactive experience and games was sought in photorealistic graphics. Now, interfaces and games became more immersive by requiring us to physically enact, such as with Wii or Kinect. With graphics and user interaction now part of many games, many researchers argue that haptics and motion are the next step towards increasing realism. However, when it comes to output, we have nothing more than vibrating buzzers, such as the ones that make our smartphones vibrate. In this talk, we show compelling new ultra-mobile technologies that provide exciting haptic feedback. Our approaches achieve a low hardware footprint by leveraging use our own muscle power! We will demonstrate several projects that allow for interaction to become more immersive. </i> <a href="http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/baudisch/projects/muscle-propelled-force-feedback.html"><b>More info</b></a> | <b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swmGaGT8lvs">Video preview</a></b></p> <p><br/>— <b><a href="http://www.sjorshoukes.nl/">Sjors Houkes</a></b> has supported starting game studios for years at <a href="http://www.dutchgamegarden.nl/">Dutch Game Garden</a>, by organising network events, festivals and game jams. He wants to get good at making games himself, but for the moment is way more capable as a professional voice actor.</p> <p>— <b>Giles Coope</b>, <b>Javier Díaz</b> and <b>Raphaël de Courville</b> teamed up for the second year in a row to create a game during the Global Game Jam in Berlin.
