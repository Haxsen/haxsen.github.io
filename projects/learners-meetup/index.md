While a lot of formats are on specific tools and languages, the Learners Meetup is a language-agnostic monthly meetup for all learners to get to know each other and learn more general principles and concepts of technology and programming.

After up to two language-agnostic beginner-friendly tech-talks, the meetup continues with a "Mini-Bar-Camp". Each and everyone is called upon to create up to three post-its about topics and questions they'd like to talk about. Those then get collected and grouped per topic all together. Out of that groups of participants are formed, with at least one coach umong them, to discuss the topic at hand.

If you are interested in organising a Learners meetup, [there is a great handbook about it](/handbooks/learners-meetups.html).
